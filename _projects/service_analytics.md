Modern transport systems generate vast amounts of data—timetables, ticketing feeds, mobile-device datasets, GPS traces, socio-economic datasets and behavioural surveys. Turning these into meaningful insight requires not just technical skill, but deep domain knowledge. With extensi experience working with transport datasets of every kind, Amodellis provides end-to-end analytics services that support policy development, operational decision-making and long-term planning.

We blend traditional transport analysis with modern techniques from data science, automation and statistical modelling, enabling public authorities, operators and investors to make decisions based on clear, evidence-led insights.

#### **Relevant Experience**

###### **Bus Timetable Integration - Transport for the North**
Developed a prototype analytical system using BODS GTFS feeds to generate accessibility metrics for authority partners across the North of England.

###### **Tolling & Road Pricing – Multiple International Projects**
Led extensive data-driven analysis for international toll road and managed-lane studies. Work included large-scale data acquisition using APIs and automated web-scraping tools to collect traffic counts, travel-time data, speed profiles and congestion indicators. Conducted spatial and temporal analysis of traffic patterns, developed travel-time reliability metrics, and integrated multi-source datasets to support pricing strategy, demand-risk assessment and investment-grade revenue forecasting.
