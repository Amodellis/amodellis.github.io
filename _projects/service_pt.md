Public transport modelling provides the analytical foundation for service planning, investment decisions and network performance assessment. From bus network analytics to multi-modal public transport models, Amodellis offers specialist modelling and advisory services built on hands-on experience across the UK and internationally.

We combine traditional model development with modern data science approaches, working with GTFS/BODS feeds, timetable analytics, assignment modelling and demand forecasting frameworks to produce actionable insights for operators, authorities and investors.

##### **Services Offered**

###### **Public Transport Model Development**
We develop and enhance PT models for a wide range of applications, including:
- Bus and rail network modelling in PTV Visum, Emme and TfL's Railplan  
- GTFS/BODS-based timetable and service analytics  
- Public transport assignment models (frequency-based or schedule-based)  
- Model calibration, validation and scenario forecasting  
- Integrated modelling within multi-modal frameworks (highway + PT)

###### **Bus Network & Service Analysis**
Insight-driven analysis for:
- Service planning and restructuring  
- Accessibility metrics (catchment, connectivity and travel-time analysis)  
- Bus service improvement plans
- Fare policy analysis and elasticity-based demand forecasting  
- Schedule design and timetable optimisation  

###### **Rail Demand & Station Analysis**
Experience includes:
- Forecasting rail demand under service, frequency or capacity changes  
- Application of PDFH guidance for demand responses, elasticities and forecasting
- Station and corridor-level modelling  
- Event, disruption and engineering works analysis
- Interaction with highway and bus modes for multi-modal systems

###### **Model Audits & Technical Assurance**
Independent review of public transport models, including:
- Data inputs (timetables, fares, networks, surveys)  
- Assignment structures
- Interactions with variable demand and highway models  
- Demand forecasting processes  
- TAG compliance and appraisal readiness

##### **Recent Experience**

###### **PT Model Development - Multiple Authorities**
Led and contributed to the development of large-scale, TAG-compliant public transport models for the West of England (WERTM) and South West & Mid Wales (SWMWTM). Responsibilities included Visum bus network development, GTFS timetable integration, calibration/validation, and multi-modal forecasting to support strategic transport appraisal.

###### **Bus Timetable Integration - Transport for the North**
Developed a prototype analytical system using BODS GTFS feeds to generate accessibility metrics for authority partners across the North of England.

###### **Railplan Modelling - Multiple London Developments**
Led Railplan-based public transport modelling for major development schemes including the Enfield Local Plan, Dagenham Green and Canada Water Dockside. Delivered base model audits, Local Model Updates and future-year forecasts to assess patronage impacts, mitigation measures and planning compliance.
