Last week, as I continue establishing the Amodellis practice, I had the opportunity to deliver a four-day executive training programme for a 20-person delegation from the Ministry of Interior of Saudi Arabia. The opportunity came through an introduction from Fred Ewing and was commissioned by *Community Revival*.  

The course was titled *Travel Demand Modelling*, and I was given a rough outline to work from. The structure was sensibly progressive:

- **Day 1:** data ecosystems and governance  
- **Day 2:** descriptive analytics and visualisation  
- **Day 3:** travel demand modelling theory  
- **Day 4:** predictive analytics  

A nice balance of fundamentals and application — enough theory to be meaningful, but not so much that the purpose of modelling got lost.

Below are a few reflections from my teaching experience.

#### **Visualisation is king**

We all *know* this, but the session made it obvious. Participants were most engaged when exploring data visually.  

Of the many official data portals demonstrated, the one that grabbed everyone’s attention was National Highways’ [**WebTRIS**](https://webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk), with its clean UI and API support. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the idea of [**accessibility mapping**](https://labs.podaris.com/unofficial-dft-connectivity-metric/) — something I personally value a lot — felt less familiar to the group. I hope a seed of *transport equity* thinking was planted along the way.

When it came to modelling outputs, they absolutely loved the 3D animations shown on the [**OpenPaths**](https://www.bentley.com/software/openpaths/#video) website.

#### **Inspiring public dashboards**

While searching for dashboard examples, I discovered several impressive *unofficial* public transport dashboards, such as:

- the Railway Ticket Sales & Ridership Dashboard by [**Carlos Pacheco**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carlos.pacheco/viz/RailwayDashboard/Dashboard1)  
- various analytics dashboards by [**Richard Rowson**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.rowson/vizzes)

There is something refreshing about well-crafted grassroots tools. Perhaps a future side-project for Amodellis.

#### **Smart Motorways: an unexpected crowd favourite**

Despite their resilience with modelling theory, participants were distinctly more excited about learning how the UK’s Smart Motorway system works. I added a few slides — and happily learned a lot myself.

Some fun facts that stood out:

1. Reconfiguring parts of the motorway network into all-lane-running (ALR) smart motorways since 2023 cost [**£5b**](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2025-01-07/HL3835/) — a huge number, but still only a fraction of rail investment.  
2. To manage congestion and prevent shockwave braking, each motorway section is individually calibrated using historical data so that signals activate only when truly necessary.  

I also watched a TRL video on the [**SMCALO**](https://smcalo.org/Home.aspx) system for monitoring traffic. I now want a copy running on my own machine.

#### **How much has Riyadh changed?**

I told participants about my stint in Riyadh back in 2014, when I worked on planning for the Riyadh Metro. I used to drive from the Diplomatic Quarter to Al Sulaimaniyah — driving like a maniac just to survive the flow.  

Participants assured me that things are far calmer now and invited me to return. I am not entirely convinced… especially as my own driving style has slowed with age!

#### **The wonderful Nano Banana Pro**

My course prep coincided with the arrival of a fantastic new LLM tool for generating graphics. Text placement is no longer chaotic, and the images make coherent sense for teaching.  

It feels like a genuine step forward. At the moment, **Gemini 3** edges out **ChatGPT-5** for illustration work, at least in my hands.

    </div>
</div>


#### **Agentic AI steals the show**

The standout moment came courtesy of [**Nathan Watts**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-watt-390b6165/) from [**TransHumanity.AI**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/transhumanity_innovation-transportmodelling-agenticai-activity-7402716914281775104-dge2), who demonstrated an agentic-AI tool capable of extracting insights from prompts about Manchester data — traffic, accidents, weather and more.

Surprise Surpise! Participants asked more questions in his half-hour session than in the rest of the four days combined...

The message landed clearly: [**AI in transport**]({{ "/projects/service_research/" | relative_url }}) is no longer optional — it is here, useful and inevitable. And hopefully Amodellis can contribute in our own small way in the future too.

### **Thanks to the people who made it work**

This course would not have been successful without:

- [**Naim Kishi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naim-kishi-395654397/), the superb real-time translator — my first time teaching through live translation. The pauses between sentences turned out to be a blessing, giving me space to read the room and adjust the pace.  
- [**Abid Satwilkar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abid-satwilkar-17855457/) from Community Revival, for trusting me with the assignment and supporting the week throughout.  
- [**Fred Ewing**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredewing/), known to just about every modeller in the UK, for the introduction and encouragement.  

It was a hugely positive week — and with luck, future training sessions will welcome a more gender-diverse group of participants as opportunities for women in transport continue to grow across Saudi Arabia.
