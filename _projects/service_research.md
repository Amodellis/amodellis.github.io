We are expanding our consultancy offering into a new area that bridges **transport research**, **open-source software development**, and **AI applications in transport systems**. Our goal is to collaborate with academic and consulting partners to develop **transparent, accessible, and research-driven transport modelling tools**, while contributing to funded research and applied innovation projects.

---

#### **What We Aim to Offer**

###### **1. Collaborative Research & Innovation Projects**
We are seeking opportunities to partner with universities, research groups, and consultancies on projects involving:

- AI-assisted modelling workflows  
- Data-driven methods aligned with national priorities such as sustainability, resilience, inclusivity, and network optimisation  
- Early-stage concepts for grant applications, feasibility studies, and pilot development  

---

###### **2. Open-Source Software for Transport Applications**
We plan to expand our GitHub portfolio with open-source tools that support:

- Behavioural and demand modelling  
- Public transport analytics  
- AI and machine learning integration in modelling workflows  
- Reproducibility through shared datasets, examples, and documentation  

The aim is to create community-driven modelling frameworks that support both academic research and industry practice.

---

###### **3. AI & Data-Driven Transport Innovation**
We are particularly interested in working on use cases such as:

- Predictive analytics and intelligent automation  
- Network performance optimisation  
- Inclusive mobility applications  
- Climate resilience and long-term planning  

These areas reflect key government challenge themes for AI in transport innovation programmes.

---

###### **4. Partnership on Research Funding & Grants**
We are open to collaborating on applications for:

- Government-funded innovation programmes  
- Academic–industry research partnerships  
- Digital transport and AI research grants  
- Feasibility studies and prototype development  

We can contribute to technical concept development, modelling methodology, and implementation planning.

---

#### **Why This Direction?**

Although we are new to formal research funding and open-source development, this path is a natural progression of our transport modelling interests. It allows us to:

- Work collaboratively on ambitious, forward-looking challenges  
- Develop practical, AI-enabled tools for real-world problems  
- Support transparent and accessible modelling practices  
- Help shape the future of digital and intelligent transport systems

####     **Get in Touch**

If you are an academic, consultant, or organisation exploring AI-enabled transport modelling or seeking collaborators for research bids, We would be very happy to discuss potential partnerships.

**Let us work together to design and build innovative, open, and impactful tools for the transport sector.**
