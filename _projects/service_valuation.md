Discrete choice models lie at the core of behavioural analysis in transport, capturing how people choose between alternatives—modes, routes, destinations, pricing options, products and more. They provide a rigorous framework for understanding preferences and forecasting behavioural change.

With more than two decades of experience in both academic and applied settings, Amodellis offers advanced discrete choice modelling services grounded in econometric theory, practical evidence and modern statistical tools.

#### **Relevant Experience**

###### **Tolling & Road Pricing – Multiple International Projects**
Designed and estimated discrete choice models for toll choice, willingness-to-pay and diversion behaviour across the UK, US, Canada, Greece, Georgia, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Applications included pricing strategy, demand-risk assessment and investment-grade revenue forecasting.

###### **Bid-Rent Location Choice Model in LUTI framework**
Co-developed the UK's first microeconomic bid-rent location choice model within a LUTI framework, building a bespoke discrete choice-based framework for household and firm location decisions, including the estimation of bid functions and rent-auction parameters.

###### **UK National Value of Travel Time Study**
Contributed to research on the UK’s national values of travel time, focusing on the estimation of income elasticities of values of time. This included developing and testing econometric specifications to understand how the value of time varies across income groups and trip purposes.

###### **Market Engagement Study – Battery Electric Buses**
Developed a choice-based conjoint analysis to quantify operator preferences for Battery Electric Buses (BEB) attributes. Estimated attribute importance, performance sensitivities and market appeal, informing product development strategies.
