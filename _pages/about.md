Amodellis is a newly formed UK-based consultancy focused on transport modelling and applied mobility research. We aim to explore emerging analytical techniques, behaviourally informed models, and innovative data sources to better understand how people and systems move — and how they may move in the future.

Our work brings together developing approaches in forecasting, discrete choice modelling, machine-learning methods, and economic evaluation. We work with public bodies, engineering consultancies, investors, and research institutions to deliver careful, transparent, and practical analysis.

As we establish the practice, we remain actively open to freelance and partnership opportunities.
