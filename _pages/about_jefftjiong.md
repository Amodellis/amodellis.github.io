**Jeff Tjiong • Founder & Director**

I work at the intersection of transport data, modelling, and decision-making. For over 20 years, I have used evidence – from household travel surveys and stated-preference data to multi-modal models – to understand how people travel and how transport systems evolve.

My consulting experience spans transport data analytics, investment-grade traffic and revenue forecasting, elasticity-based demand modelling, multi-modal travel demand modelling and appraisal, and spatial–economic modelling. Along the way, I have worked on a range of projects I am proud of, including:

- Serving as lead auditor and subject-matter expert for **[HS2’s PLANET Framework](https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=HS2+Planet+Framework+Model)** Model Update, ensuring methodological rigour and model assurance.  
- Developing the prototype system for TfN’s **[Bus Timetable Analytics](https://aetransport.org/past-etc-papers/search-all-etc-conference-papers?abstractId=8384&state=b)** using BODS GTFS feeds, producing accessibility metrics for regional partners.
- Enhancing TfN’s **[Northern Model Integration Tool](https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand?tab=readme-ov-file#elasticity-model)** with an elasticity-based demand adjustment model for future scenario analysis, supported by extensive benchmarking of demand elasticities.  
- Co-developing the UK’s first **[microeconomic bid-rent location choice model](https://aetransport.org/past-etc-papers/search-all-etc-conference-papers?abstractId=4233&state=b)**, leading all choice model estimation.  

My academic work includes contributing to research on the UK’s **[national values of travel time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0739885921001402)** as part of my PhD, supervised by the exceptional **[Professor Stephane Hess](https://www.stephanehess.me.uk)** and **[Professor Thijs Dekker](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/929/professor-thijs-dekker)**, and more recently exploring recurrent neural networks for **activity-scheduling analysis**.

In the past two years at Oxford Economics, I produced **investment-grade T&R forecasts** for major managed-lane systems in Nashville and Atlanta (USA), and advised on pricing strategy, demand risk and due diligence for the M6toll.

Most recently, I founded **Amodellis Ltd.**, where I focus on bringing modern data science, automation and advanced modelling techniques into everyday transport planning – doing my small part to push the field forward.
