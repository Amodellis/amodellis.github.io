Traffic and revenue (T&R) forecasting underpins the financial viability of toll roads, managed lanes and major transport infrastructure. It requires a careful balance of behavioural modelling, economic analysis and commercial insight. With more than two decades of experience in investment-grade forecasting worldwide, Amodellis provides robust, defensible and transparent T&R analysis for public authorities, private investors and lenders.

I combine traditional transport modelling approaches with behavioural research, discrete choice modelling, elasticity analysis and modern data sources (e.g. GPS, mobile-device datasets, observed pricing data) to deliver forecasts that are both technically sound and commercially relevant.
